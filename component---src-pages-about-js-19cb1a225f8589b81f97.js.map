I started my own landscape design\n            company because I wanted to be able to ensure that each design Iâ€™m\n            putting out into the world seamlessly puts those three things\n            together.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Primula Horticulture &amp; Design provides full-scale landscape\n            plans, planting plans, outdoor planter design and install, and\n            indoor planter design and install. During and since my education at\n            Utah State University, I have been practicing landscape design for\n            almost 8 years. Throughout those years and before starting Primula\n            Horticulture &amp; Design in 2018, I have worked for landscape\n            design firms big and small in both the residential and commercial\n            sectors.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Growing up in the very cold and very dry Cache Valley, I have always\n            valued plant knowledge and staying current and up-to-date when it\n            comes to plants. When I moved to Salt Lake, I worked for local\n            nurseries before jumping right into design to ensure that my\n            know-how was sharp. The more you know, the more exciting and\n            different materials you can use and still be successful in our\n            climate. A plan from Primula Horticulture &amp; Design will not be a\n            cut and paste product.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </article>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nconst indexQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n    benchAccounting: file(relativePath: { eq: \"profile-pic.jpg\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1360) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n\nexport default props => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={indexQuery}\n    render={data => (\n      <AboutPage location={props.location} data={data} {...props} />\n    )}\n  />\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
