description: "This design is a redo of an existing backyard that had a few things to keep, and more than a few things to change. Together, with the client, a final design was decided upon. The design goal was to keep all the things the clients already liked about their space, but to change the things that they weren't in love with. Overall the result is a traditional design that's full of color and interest, but one that is neat and manageable for homeowners."
