          <p>
            My goal as a landscape designer is to create something beautiful,
            functional, and unique for you. I started my own landscape design
            company because I wanted to be able to ensure that each design Iâ€™m
            putting out into the world seamlessly puts those three things
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Primula Horticulture &amp; Design provides full-scale landscape
            plans, planting plans, outdoor planter design and install, and
            indoor planter design and install. During and since my education at
            Utah State University, I have been practicing landscape design for
            almost 8 years. Throughout those years and before starting Primula
            Horticulture &amp; Design in 2018, I have worked for landscape
            design firms big and small in both the residential and commercial
            sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up in the very cold and very dry Cache Valley, I have always
            valued plant knowledge and staying current and up-to-date when it
            comes to plants. When I moved to Salt Lake, I worked for local
            nurseries before jumping right into design to ensure that my
            know-how was sharp. The more you know, the more exciting and
            different materials you can use and still be successful in our
            climate. A plan from Primula Horticulture &amp; Design will not be a
            cut and paste product.
